Online ssh interface using docker and websockets.

## ⚡ Before you get going ⚡
Make sure you have installed [Node and NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

If you have the dependencies for this project, pop open a terminal (`ctrl-alt-t` for all you nasty neck-beards) and get ready to copy-pasta some commands.

Download the project:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/maxchehab/wssh.git
$ cd wssh
```
Using npm, install the neccessary dependencies.
```bash
$ npm install
```
Some fancy text will start scrolling down matrix style. If you are in a public area with an audience, this is a great opportunity to F11 your terminal and rollplay as 4chan, the internet's greatest hacker.

Awesome? No errors? Perfect! Just...
```bash
$ npm run docker
$ npm run start
```
